In the grand scheme of things, with all the competing interests out there, perhaps the world isn't exactly pining for another sports blog. Be that as it may, 
I'm going to take advantage of what I feel is a lull in quality distractions right now. In fact, the way I see it, 
Marvel, lately, can't make a decent movie to save its proverbial life. The vast majority of popular music is indecipherable noise. 
Books (who reads books anymore)? TV, once a huge time suck, 
now ruined by the proliferation of streaming services that have managed to re-create the bloated expensive cable company piecemeal. 
Right now, I think my only competition for your attention are dancing cats and people falling on their faces. 
Also, I believe I have a handful of things going for me that I hope will prevent this Blog from going into oblivion.
<b>My undying love for my home team the Mariners</b>
<br>Sometimes it feels more like undead than undying. Like a mutilated zombie long relieved of it's appendages, dragging itself along like 
some self-propelled ball and chain. However, despite the few ups and the many downs, I just can't give up hope that one day I'm going to 
experience again something akin to the 116-win season of 2001 or the Refuse to Lose magic of '95. Yes, I am that old.<br> <br>
<b>My fascination with data and my small talent for it</b><br>
I'm a Data Analyst by trade and a nerd by birth. As I've already dated myself, I can comfortably relate how, as a young man, 
I would anxiously anticipate the arrival of the Wednesday edition of the Seattle Times. 
The Wednesday rag, unlike the other editions, contained a full complement of stats for every team. 
A veritable cornucopia of delectable statistical tidbits that were impossible to resist. 
How much did Edgar Martineâ€™s batting average climb since last week, is he still the frontrunner for the batting title? 
Is Griffey Jr. still flirting with an MVP season?
These were some of the many swirling inquiries that only the Grand Oracle of statistical knowledge could reveal.<br><br>
<b>My current lack of employment</b><br>
So I mentioned that I am a Data Analyst by trade. Well, turns out that gainful employment in tech right now is tough sledding as we, 
the proletariat, try to convince our overlords that we are not all imminently expendable. In that I'm playing the long game. 
Knowing that artificial intelligence is nothing of the sort but is instead just the collective regurgitated body of human knowledge, 
skillfully collected, packaged and marketed by billionaires and then sold back to us at a premium.<br>
Furthermore, as we become more and more reliant on this so-called "artificial intelligence" we, as a society, 
will contribute less and less to said body of knowledge consequently creating a viscous downward-spiral of diminishing returns. 
Thus, finally bringing about the Idiocracy that the great Mike Judge prognosticated many moons ago. 
And no, I did not ask Chat-GPT to give me a fancy word for predicted. Ok. Fuck you. I did!<br>
Anyway, I find myself with a little more time on my hands than I'm used to. In addition, I'm banking on the fact that there are at least a few nerds, 
perhaps even some Marinerds (see what I did there?) that, like me, are sitting around waiting for the gravy train to stop and pick them up. 
In the meantime, we might as well gorge on baseball minutiae while we suckle on the teat of unemployment.<br><br>
<b>With all that being said</b><br>
I hope that I captured you attention and perhaps even your imagination as we dive down the rabbit hole together. The plan for this blog is to
dig into the meat and potatoes of baseball statistics. To ask compelling questions that lead to more questions that possibly might lead to 
an answer or two.  There will be charts and graphs and, hopefully, plenty of laughs. 
Lastly, and most importantly, I will do my damnedest to not ever ever insult your intelligence by 
peppering my articles with insipid nautical terminology. Of this, I do vow!<br>
Thank you for your precious time and I hope you will spare some more time to read further as the season or seasons progress.
